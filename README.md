[bgfx android activity](https://github.com/nodrev/bgfx-android-activity) - Android glue for bgfx
================================================================================================

A minimal Android Activity using `NativeActivity` class which allows to run [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx)'s examples onto Android platforms.

# Prerequisites
**Remark**: Although those build instructions assume a linux platform to generate the APKs, the used tools are available for OSX and MSWindows. As a result, the specified commands should be easily adapted to work for those platforms.

## Android Studio
This project uses [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) build system, Gradle, to generate Android's APK files, so you need to download it and install it properly. Android Studio comes with Android SDK, so no need to install it separatly.

*Following commands assume it was installed to `~/android/android-studio` directory.*

## Android NDK
[Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html) is required to compile bgfx for android platforms. You can install it using Android Studio's SDK Manager. 
*Following commands assume it was installed to `~/android/sdk/ndk-bundle` directory.*

## Environment variables
```shell
sudo pluma /etc/profile.d/ndk.sh
```
Add the following lines:
```shell
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=~/android/sdk/ndk-bundle
export ANDROID_NDK_CLANG=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64
export ANDROID_NDK_ARM=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64
export ANDROID_NDK_X86=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/x86-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64
```
*Note: Historically the NDK supported 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS (and so does `bgfx`), but support was removed in NDK r17.*

You can also extend the `PATH` variable to be able to access Android platform tools (`adb`, `dmtracedump`, etc) from the shell:
```shell
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools
```

You may need to reboot in order to reload those environment variables.

# Setup project

## Clone repositories
```shell
mkdir bgfx-android
cd bgfx-android
git clone https://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git
git clone https://github.com/bkaradzic/bimg.git
git clone https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git
git clone https://github.com/nodrev/bgfx-android-activity.git
```

## Compile
Compile BGFX samples for every android abi we want to support:
```shell
cd bgfx
make projgen
make android-arm & make android-x86
```

# Build APK

## Copy bgfx files
Copy the libraries corresponding to the bgfx sample you want to try to the jniLibs directory.
```shell
cp ./build/android-arm/bin/libexample-00-helloworldRelease.so ../bgfx-android-activity/app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a
cp ./build/android-x86/bin/libexample-00-helloworldRelease.so ../bgfx-android-activity/app/src/main/jniLibs/x86
```

## Import the project to Android Studio
TODO
Launch android studio, and import the project.

## Modify application ID
Edit `bgfx-android-activity/app/build.gradle`, and replace `applicationId` with your own application id:
```
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId 'com.nodrev.bgfx.examples.helloworld'
        minSdkVersion 14
        targetSdkVersion 23
        versionCode 100 // Application version, 3 digits, major/minor/revision
        versionName "1.0.0"
    }
```

Edit `bgfx-android-activity/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, and set `package` value to the same application id:
```
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.nodrev.bgfx.examples.helloworld">
    [...]
</manifest>
```

## Modify application name
Edit `bgfx-android-activity/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`, and replace `app_name` value with your application name
```
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">BGFX Helloworld</string>
</resources>
```

## Define the library name
To define the .so file to load by the native activity, you have to edit `bgfx-android-activity/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
```
<activity android:name="android.app.NativeActivity"
    <!-- Tell NativeActivity the name of our .so (strip 'lib' and '.so') -->
    <meta-data android:name="android.app.lib_name"
               android:value="example-00-helloworldRelease" />
</activity>
```

## Examples resource files
Some examples requires resource files, you will need to copy them to the Android device (physical or emulator) SDCard using `adb`:
```shell
adb push bgfx/examples/runtime /sdcard/bgfx/examples/runtime
```

**Remark:** This is not the official way to do for a real application, runtime files should be embedded into APK, but for bgfx examples, we go that way.

## Packaging
Rebuild the project, build APK, and test the application!

**Remark:** Generated APKs goes to `bgfx-android-activity/app/build/outputs/apk` directory.
